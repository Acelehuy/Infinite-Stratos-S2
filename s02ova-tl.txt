IS OVA script:
Ichika-san!
You alright?
Let's hurry and go to the pool!
But where's everyone else?
E-everyone's already there!
So we need to hurry!
I see, you're in a hurry to go in the pool.  
I did it!
Shall we go?
It was nice of Cecelia to buy us these.
Yeah.
Huh? Where's Cecelia?
Now that you mention it, I don't see her.
No way!
She tricked us!
We need to split into two groups and look for them.
Pools really are the best in the summer.
Hey, I haven't seen anyone since just now, are you sure they're here?
That's odd.
Cecelia!?
Where did they go?
They're not here either.  
Alright, let's look over there.
What's with you all of a sudden?
That was really dangerous.  
Oh it's Orimura.
Hey!
Nohoho-san! Everyone did come.
Many of the girls from the IS Academy are here.  
Ooh, captain, Cecelia's wearing a perverted swimsuit.
Really?
How bold!
Cecelia is so lewd.  
I'm not lewd!
Orimu, bye-bye!
Cecelia?
We've finally found you.
Alright, get over here.
Ooh!
What's wrong?
This is called the pair-slide course.  
Looks interesting.  
We've got no choice.  I guess we can slide together.  
That's unfair of you Houki, let's decide it with paper rock scissors.  
You- Fine...
Rock, paper, scissors!
Okay, let me explain the pair-slide. 
First, the guy sits here.
Huh? Okay.
And then the girl sits between his legs.  
Um, like this?
And then the guy holds the girl tightly from behind, like this.
Are you ready Charlotte?
Whenever you are! 
My bad.
Not, it's fine...
Come on, it's dangerous so you need to stay close together.
Alright, see you!
Ichika!
It's not on purp-
Sorry...
Ichika, you pervert.
It wasn't on purpose!
It was inevitable!
But you touched them.  
You're late, Ichika.  What are you doing?
Alright, let me explain the pair-slide.
First, the guy sits down.
Then, the girl sits between his legs and the guy grabs her from behind.  
Houki, mind sitting behind me?
Isn't that backwards?
Well the water's pretty strong; it might be best for you to hide your face behind me.
Alright, I got ya.
Like this?
The tighter you hold on, the safer you are.  
This alright?
Yeah, well...
Well then, off you go!
That speed was great, wasn't it? 
Yeah...
What's wrong? Did you get hurt?
No...
Your back's...gotten bigger.
What about my back?
Ichika! Hurry up!
How many times do I have to do this?
Seriously, running into them even here.
Orimura-sensei, is it okay that you aren't by Ichika-kun? He is your little brother.  
This is my day off, if I mess with them it'll be a waste.
What is it? I understand. I'll be there.  
What is it? Is it urgent?
Yeah.
Ichika!
So pretty! What are these?
First time I've seen them.  
It's called goldfish-catching.
You use this to catch goldfish.
Looks interesting!
Ichika, teach me.  
Me as well.  
Okay, okay.  
Wait your turn.
Like this. 
If this happens, you lose.
R-really now?
I get it now.  
Not the devil fish.
You eat the octopus...  
This is traditional Japanese food.
Tasty, isn't it? See, Laura?
This is pretty good.
It's delicious!
Now it's my turn to say "ahhn" at Houki.
What?
Ichika-san, "ahh".  
Hey, you there!
No one can shoot sharper than I!  
That's a toy gun, though...
As one would expect. [of you]
I'm also pretty good at this.
I've had some marksmanship traning in the military, of course.
Houki.
What is it?
Have you gotten better at shooting?
What about you?
Well I'm more of a close-combat type.
Me too.
That's why it's okay if you're bad at shooting.
Yeah!
Damnit.
Oh, that might be a stretch.
No, I have to defeat it!
We'll, cover you Laura.
We have no choice.  
Well, only this once.  
Yup.
Then I'll join the battle too.  
Line up.
Together.
Fire!
We did it!
The summer is over, huh?
It looks like it's my debut.
I am Tatenashi Sarashiki.
