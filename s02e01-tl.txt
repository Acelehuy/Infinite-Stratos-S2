IS S2 EP 1 script:
I'm coming too!
Just a bit more!
Ichika! Ichika!
Chifuyu-ne-
I will kill you.
I will kill you.
Ichika Orimura
EH?
Morning already?
Laura!? Doing this again-
Today,
I'm not naked!
What's with that outfit?
This was advice from a great assistant. (I don't know if this makes sense in context)
You should get rid of those, really. (But not in a lewd way) 
There's only one reason I was waiting for you to wake up.
Here.
What's this?
What? The end of summer festival date?
Isn't this an event at the water park that got built last year?
I've been wanting to go there.
Really? Wanna go?
Oh, there's even yukata rentals at the festival grounds.  
I want to try wearing a yukata. Just the two of us.
Alright let's go with everyo-
What? What's her issue?
Ojou-sama, thanks for doing your duty for Britain this summer vacation.
Of course, I'm a Orkett (family name?) after all.
More importantly, I've finally been able to return.
It's best to be under the same sky as the one I love after all.
Hey Cecelia.
Ichika-san!
Did he come out here just for me?
I couldn't sit still when I heard you were coming back, Cecelia!
Ichika-san, no we can't...
Not in a place like this!
Cecelia?
Cecelia?
Huh? I'm alright.  I just drifted for a second.  
Is that all? Glad you're alright.
Anyway, wanna go to this with me tomorrow?
Going somewhere with Ichika-san?
I, Cecelia Alcott, will prepare fully!  
Not this again, they aren't aware enough of their position as a bride.  
Did something happen, Laura?
Oh nothing..
Say Laura, you got time for clothes shopping today?
What are you talking about? My clothes are my military uniform.  
You need more than military uniforms. It's the end of summer, let's go!
Well, when you put it that way.
Is it alright if we go around 10 am?
Okay...
So what do you think?
These clothes are for going out.
School uniform after all, eh?
ne, ne, ne, do you know about the coastal oil crepe?
Hey, hey, do you know the rumors about the elusive crepe of Rinkai Park?
Yeah, yeah!
If you eat a mix-berry flavored one with the person you like, your love will be fulfilled!
Right! But it's always sold out.
Love will be fulfilled... Mix-berry?
Cold.
Aww, Summer break is ending tomorrow, and I still haven't made any memories with Ichika.
I stayed here instead of flying home, so I wish he'd initiate at least once.
Hey Rin!
Ichika!?
I'm coming in.
Wait a second!
Welcome!
Perfect silver, and blonde too!
No, No.
Could I interest you in the newest clothing line?
Woah, it's light and slightly transparent.
White?
It's not bad, but I'm already wearing white.
Well, we're here, so you might as well try them, right?
No, it's too mu-
No "It's a hassle"-s.
I don't really get it myself, but,
Am I unappealing to boys?
This is ridiculous.
If I was going to get one, it might as well have been something cute.
Then maybe Ichika would compliment me.
Laura, those clothes look cute on you.
Only the clothes? 
Of course, you're the cutest.
You idiot..
How's it going Laura? You finished?
Huh? You still have your uniform on.  
Charlotte.
Don't tell me that you didn't like it.  
No, not exactly,
but I want something a bit cuter.  
Oh, got it.
Cute clothes huh? What kind do you want?
I want something that shows a bit of skin.
Trust me!
Pretty!
She's like a fairy!
Laura!
You got shoes too?
I'm surprised.
We might as well.
You alright?
Sorry.
I wonder if I can take a picture! Me too!
Your welcome.
It looks like my breast grew again.
Houki! You there?
Ichika?
What is it?
I've been looking for you Houki! Is this a good time? 
Wait a moment!
What is it?
You were in the middle of a shower?
Yeah, so what did you want?
Shall we go to this together?
Since this was so sudden, It's fine if you don't.  
I will!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
That was exhasuting.
You should have left it on just for the sake of it.
Well, um...I didn't want to get it dirty.
Don't tell me, did you want Ichika to be the first to see?
Absolutely wrong.
You two! Want a part time job?
Huh?
Why am I dressed like a butler?
Come on, you're much cooler and handsome than those guys.  
Really?
I would have preferred a maid uniform too.  
Maybe I'm just this kind of person after all?
Don't worry, you look great!
Really?
Welcome to Cafe After cruise.
Sorry to keep you waiting.  
Would you like black tea?
Sure.
If you have any requests, please call me.  Ojou-Sama.  
Don't move your hands!
Keep it down!
We have you surrounded!
Come out quietly!
If you want these hostages out alive, get us a car ready!
Make sure to leave off any tracking devices too!
They're afraid.
Hey, you there! I'm thirsty. Bring me a menu.  
What's this?
It's water.
Shut up. Drink.
If you can!
Wha-
Don't mess around, you brat!
I'll clean you up!
She's not alone, unfortunately for you!
Situation under control.
What about you, Laura?
No problems. Under control.  
You've gotta be kidding me! Being stopped by these brats!
Too slow. Die.
The situation is completely under control.  
We're saved!
Thanks, Maid and Butler!  
Laura, if it's found out that we're representative(?) cadets, it'll be troublesome, so we should leave.  
Yeah. Let's leave it to the police. 
I'd rather take you all with me than rot in prison!
Checkmate!
You want more?
Your wrists are next.
Excuse me! 2 crepes please.
Mix-berry.
Sorry, but we're out of mix-berry.  
Is that so?
Laura, you got anything else in mind?
Okay then, strawberry and blueberry please.  
Here. Thank you very much.  
This is tasty, isn't it?
Yeah. This is my first time eating a crepe, but I think it's delicious.	
I hope next time I can come and eat a mix-berry one with Ichika.
Charlotte.
What is it?
Laura...
There was cream on your face.
B-but!
My hands are full.
Don't get so mad.
Here, have a bite of my crepe.  
Let's eat. 
Oh yeah, about the crepe store, there wasn't any mix-berry in the first place.
You didn't see it on the menu, did you?
There weren't any sauces in the kitchen that looked like it either.
Is that right?
You're very observant.   
But you were able to eat it anyway, right?
Oh, the strawberry and blueberry!
Correct.
So that's the secret behind the mix-berry always out of stock.
What's this?
These are really pajamas?
So cute!
Laura, it's looks really good on you!
Don't embrace me! I can't move!  
Nope.  Cats are supposed sit nice and quietly on people's laps.
Why don't you say "Nyan", just for the hell of it?
I refuse.
Why do I have to do such things?
Ehh? But it'll be so cute.
C'mon, say it. Nyan. 
N-nyan.
Laura, you're so cute!!
Yeah, come in!
Hey.
Those are some weird outfits.
A black and white cat.
Oh right, about tomorrow,
Intruder in the 6-D core, intercept immediately.
I repeat, Intruder in the 6-D core, intercept immediately.  
Can you hear me?
Your body has surveillance nanomachines.  
Complete your mission as directed/
She's there! 
What a bother.
"Don't kill."?
Good girl, M. I'll be looking forward to our next meeting.  
What is your objective?
She's taking on an IS naked?
I'll have the IS sealed in this base, the Infinite Stratos.
What?
Deploy.
Silent Zephyrus?
It can't be, Phantom Task?
Ichika was more assertive than usual.
He's so helpless, getting so flustered asking me on a date.
Hey everyone! My bad My bad! I'm late.
Idiot.
I'm the idiot for expecting anything!
Playing with the hearts of girls, you're the worst!
Well, I thought it would be something like this.
You fail as a bride!
What's going on?
Hurry, let's get in the pool!  
Ichika, hurry up!
I got tricked!  
Cecelia has a very perverted swimsuit.  
It's not perverted!
There's something called the hair slide here.
There's no other choice, I guess we can slide together.  
He hugged her!
Where are they going now?
What is it so suddenly?
Hu-huh?
Ichika, you pervert.  
Really now?
It's true!
How beautiful!
What's this?  
Is this your first time looking at this?
I'm going to have some octopus.
This is game over huh?
Wha-what?
This is pretty good.
I'll cover you, Laura.
I've taken marksmanship training as part of the military, after all.
The summer is over, huh?
It looks like it's my turn now.
I am Tatenashi Sarashiki.

Next Time: Heart Painkiller
