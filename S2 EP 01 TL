Just a bit more!
Ichika! Ichika!

I will kill you.
I will kill you.
Ichika Orimura
EH?
Morning already?
Laura!? Doing this again-
Today,
I'm not naked!
What's with that outfit?
This was advice from a great assistant. (I don't know if this makes sense in context)
You should get rid of those, really. (But not in a lewd way) 
There's only one reason I was waiting for you to wake up.
Here.
What's this?
What? The end of summer festival date?
Isn't this an event at the water park that got built last year?
I've been wanting to go there.
Really? Wanna go?
Oh, there's even yukata rentals at the festival grounds.  
I want to try wearing a yukata. Just the two of us.
Alright let's go with everyo-
What? What's her issue?
Ojou-sama, during your summer break, it's your duty to do your best for England.
So that explains what's going on. Moving on, I'm back.  
On the other hand, I'm picturing facing the man I love in combat in the same sky as me.  
Hey Cecelia.
Ichika-san!
The pressure of the one I love is facing opposite of me.  
Cecelia, I can't write out my feelings for you.  It doesn't matter.  
Ichika-san, no we can't... This evening's position is a bit weird.*
Cecelia, Cecelia
Huh? I'm alright.  I just drifted for a second.  
Is that all? Glad you're alright.  Wanna go to this with me tomorrow?
To be in Ichika's presence? I Cecelia Alcott will be make preparations to look my best.  
Not this again, I tried to get closer to my bride.  
What did you try to do Laura?
Oh nothing..
Say Laura, you got time for clothes shopping today?
What are you talking about? My clothes are my military uniform.  
You need more than your military uniforms.   It's the end of summer, let's go!
If you say so.
Alright if we go around 10 am?
It's done then..
So what do you think?
Dangerous quality is dangerous isn't it?
The height of that is your school uniform huh?
ne, ne, ne, do you know about the coastal oil crepe?
I know it, If you eat the mixed berry with your crush, they'll fall in  love with you.   
But when's our chance?
Fall in love? Mixed berries?
Cold.  Aww Summer break is ending tomorrow so then I can protect Ichika.  I can't be late so I can meet up with him.  For once, I'd like to tempt him.  
Hey Rin!
Ichika!?
I'm coming in.
Wait a second!
Welcome! Perfect Silver and Blonde hair!* No.. No.. Could I interest you in the newest clothing line?
Woah, looks like it was sewn with light materials.  What do you think Laura?
White? It's not bad.  What colors can we try on right now?
Because of your stature, shall we try on many outfits.*
That's troublesome..
Not troublesome at all.
I don't understand myself at all.  I haven't reflected upon myself in the past year.  Stupid Stupid.  I wonder if these will look cute naturally on me.  I wonder if Ichika will complement me for it.  
Laura, those clothes look cute on you!
Only the clothes!? 
Of course, you're the cutest!
you idiot..
How's it going Laura? You alright? You still have your uniform on.  
Charlotte
Don't tell me that you couldn't find anything you wanted.  
No not exactly, but I'm looking for cute clothes.  
Oh I got it, cute clothes huh? What kinds are good?
Oh yeah. Something of quality will do.
Trust me.
Pretty! Looks like blank! (9:56)
Laura!
Getting the shoes out too huh? They look a bit weak huh?
That's just the nature of them.  You alright?
Unexcusable!
I wonder if I can take a picture! me too!
Your welcome
My boobs weren't big enough?
Houki! you there?
Ichika?
What is it?
I've been looking for you Houki! Is this a good time? 
Wait a moment!
What is it?
You were in the middle of taking a shower?
Yeah, so what did you want?
Shall we go to this together?
Since this was so sudden, It's fine if you can't.  
Alright let's go!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
That was exhasuting.
That's the nature of the situation.  You should not have come.  
Ahh well uh.. I'm worried about becoming sullied.  
Don't tell me you want to wake up next to Ichika in front of the sunrise.  
Absolutely wrong.  
You two! Want a part time job?
HUH?
Why am I the butler?
Because you look cool and awesome in men's clothing.  
Oh really?
I would have looked good in a maid outfit too.  
Still I'd love to wear that uniform.  
Don't worry, you look great!
Really?
Welcome to cafe After cruise.  
Sorry to keep you waiting.  
Would you like black tea?
Sure.
If you have any requests, please feel free to call out to me.  Ojou-Sama.  
Don't move your hands!
Split up!
You guys stand up! Come out quietly!
[Missing lines from 13:00-13:10]  The robber scene
Hey you there! I'm thirsty! I'd like a menu.  
What's this?
It's water.   Quiet down and drink it.  It's drinkable isn't it?
To avoid going into this situation, gotta use this play.* I'll give you  the spit in my mouth.  
You're alone aren't ya? That's just too bad.  I've got control of the situation. * How is your end Laura?
No problems.  I've got control.  
You've gotta be kidding me! Being stopped by these brats!
Too slow! Now die!
The situation is under control.  
We're saved! Thanks.  Maid and Butler.  
Laura, if we ran away from  this, it would have become despair.  Therefore that circumstance is a huge pain.  
Yeah I know.  I'll take a position over the city then.  
No way! Didn't think my life would turn into this extreme darkness!* I'll take all of you with me!*
Checkmate!
Not yet moving.
Next is to tell a story using the writing brush.  
Excuse me! 2 crepes please.  The mixed berries ones.
Sorry, but we're out of mixed berry.  
Is that so? Laura, you got anything in mind?
Yeah, strawberry and blueberry please.  
Here. Thank you very much.  
This is tasty isn't it?
This is the first time you've eaten a real crepe huh?
It's tasty.  
Next time I'll eat the mixed berry one with Ichika and be happy.  
Charlotte.
What is it?
Laura..
There was cream on your face.  
Therefore.  
We got a schedule to abide by.  We gotta make it happen.  Here take a bite of my crepe.  
Let's eat. 
The thing that was bad about the crepes was no mixed berry.  There was no menu either.  You couldn't see the kitchen either.  
Yeah, you're right.  You saw that one right.   
 I've  been able to eat the mixed berry.  
Oh the strawberry and the blueberry!
Your welcome.
They were serious about the mixed berry being sold out always.  
What's this?
These are really pajamas?
So cute.. Laura, it's looks really good on you.  
Don't embrace me.  It looks really bad.  
Nope.  Cats are supposed to be *blank word at 17:24* and passive One of their traits is to go Nyan.
I refuse.  Why do I have to do such things?
They're cute that's why.  C'mon let's do it.  Nyan.  
Nyan.
Laura, you're so cute!!
Yeah come in!
Hey.  Cute outfits.  A black and white cat.  Oh right, tomorrow .
