IS S2 EP 2 script:
He comes back no matter how many times I push him away
Perfect an opening in her attack patterns.
Not yet Not yet!
I got this one in the bag.  
I'll lay down the pressure.  
The first match up of the spring semester. Those two are quick aren't they? 
yeah.
In this match Orimura-kun has the superior power right?
No, that idiot isn't even thinking, he's just hurling attacks.
Rin, the next move will decide it.  
It's mine.
Your shield can't save you forever.
Afterwards I realized I could've won.  I guess I need to start thinking about my fuel consumption.  
Who's there?
What!?
Who's that?
Alright time's up. 
You fell for it.  
And you are?
Laters
If you're late, you'll piss off Orimura-sensei
Huh? woah!
Oh what's your excuse for being late?
Well, uhh.. this girl I've never seen before.  
I see, so you  prefer inviting a girl for a chat rather coming to class.  
Not true!
Dunoa,  demonstrate the rapid switch 
Now then, same word from last line, starting
Charlotte-san!?
What is it Orimura-Kun? I'll begin. Revive.
Now the student council president will explain somethings.  
Alright Alright, we hopefully have a lot in store for you guys.  I'm Saruseki Tatenashi. I'm your student council president.  After this, nice to meet you. Moving on, this semester's culture festival, each class will have their own program.  Everyone try their best.  
UH...What should we do for our program? None of these ideas work.  You idiots.  Who came up with these ideas?
I'm excited for them.  
Orimura Ichika is our property.  
Yamada-sensei, these hilariously bad plans won't do huh?
I feel pocky is right. (6:18)
Can I not entrust anyone with anything mundane?
How about a maid cafe? laura...
The customers would like it.  And then  we serve them food and drink, which will pay back what we spend on it.  
Sounds good enough to me.  Making Ichika a butler or in charge of the kitchen is ok.  
Orimura-kun? a butler? YES! How about Maid outfits? I can sew them together.  Alright then, everyone is settled with a maid cafe.  If I just act like it's a maid cafe with unique uniforms, it'll be ok.  
It's already time. 
Hey! 
The student council president?
A bit too distant.  You can call me tatenashi.
What did you want?
I came to become your IS coach.
What's with this all of a sudden? There are many coaches already and I don't need one.  
So do you think you're weak?
 So you're not intending to be that weak?
No you're  weak.  Therefore to ensure you won't remain weak, I'll train you.  
Is that all? Fine we'll have a match.  There's no way I'll lose and will play along if I do.  
Alright fine then.  
Alright then, all you have to do is defeat me once on this mat and you win.  On the other hand, if I win if you are unable to continue.  
You sure like to treat me with extreme contempt.  I'll win for sure.  
In all seriousness, Here I go.  
Whenever you're ready.  
At the IS academy , the title of student council president, the one to lead the student body, is the ultimate position.  
.  It's been 3 tries already, haven't dispatched you yet.  
Not yet!
Wonderful! A man trying his hardest.  
Thanks for that.
Ichika-kun! you pervert!
Ichika-kun, a girl's underwear form is expensive.*
Jeez, where did he go? He's only my bride.  No way he could be avoiding this situation.  Just no way.  
Riko, you have some major bed head back there.  
Where!? where!? I overslept this morning and didn't style my hair.*
That's bad.  If you don't do base grooming, Orimura-kun will think badly of you.  
Personal grooming? Alright
Ooh, so you've become a woman too huh? You're around that age.
You got it all wrong.  Instructor.   I can erase those feelings.  
Call me Orimura-sensei.
Yes. 
By the way, I saw Ichika in the nurse's office in the club building.
Nurses' office?
Wake up sweets.
What are you doing!?
Sleeping in your lap.  
Not true.  
It's ok. It's ok.  
Wait a second..
Target acquired 
I like how straight forward you are 
Alright Ichika-kun, let's begin.  
Yes...
Oh Ichika.  
I heard he was going to have a special training session with laura at arena 4.  
Today I'll be Ichika's specialty coach.  Alright then.
Student council president being a coach? 
Ichika-san, what's up with that?
This is uh...  I lost in a match.  
hmm hmm, I think it was for Ichika-kun.  Does everyone wish to collaborate?
Collaborate? 
 We don't have much time.  Let's start on the left side then.  Charlotte-chan and Cecelia-chan
show me the shooter circle float.  
A shooting battle stance then, Ichika's role will be to stand there.  
Alright let's begin.  
Ichika-san, please watch us.  
Here I go Cecelia.
I'm ready
This is? 
They're shooting and manually controlling their high level altitude at the same time get it?
When was that from?
Ichika!
What are you doing?
Really!?
What the hell!?
you guys alright?
Next is Ichika-kun's turn.  
This again really...
Let's dance.  
Not used to this.  
Alright begin firing.  
Ichika!
Ichika! you alright?
I'm alright.  Cecelia, let's continue.  
Ichika-san said that he had an interest continuing.
Alright one more time.  
Are you doing this because the Byakushiki has long range assault now?
Yes that's right.  But that's not all.  An important conclusion in one's shooting skill is the ability to breach armor. The maximum output of his charged particle gun which can't rapid fire is more like a sniper.  In other words, he focuses all of his power into shot.  But it's clear that Ichika does not have good shooting skills.  so you're making him fight in a close range battle.  yes, You're pretty sharp.  
Man I'm exhausted,.  
Welcome back! Shall I prepare dinner? A bath? Or even me? Welcome back.  You want me? Or me... 
What are you thinking? 
Nothing in particular.  The intrusion is let's be friends.  Let's wash the wavelength.  
Uhh..
Here.  A swimsuit.  Ichika-kun your reaction was so cute.  
Yes who is it?
It's me.  
I have food to give you.  Can I come in? 
Houki! No it's not good.  Sorry.  
Ichika-kun what are you doing? Oh I get it.  You don't knowing you're messing around.  
Ichika, you bastard.  you take this random girl back to your room.  Does your perversion reach no bounds? Have you bonded with her? I'll show you shame.  
Wait Wait, you can't kill me.  
I'm sorry, at the moment Ichika-kun can't be killed.  I'd be pretty mad if you did.  This match has been alright.  Your center of gravity is off.  
Yeah.  
Ichika you were very yielding with the senior.  
Damnit. 
Drop your speed.  Concentrate.  
Got it.  
Alright you got this.  Alright show me your ignition boost.  Ignition boost.  Shift a straight line maneuver from the circular orbit of your circular flow.  Break through an opponent's barrage all at once.  Use the charged particle gun at point blank range.  
Please wait a second.  What's with this all of a sudden? 
Hurry up!
Understood.   OW!
If you're charging at the same time, you can't polish the shooter flow.  
Difficult isn't it?
No good, remember this chant.  Alright get up and try again.  
Yes.
Ichika, you alright?
Oh what is it?
Want some tea? You can't eat so it's the least you can do.  
Thanks Charlotte.
Anyways, what is that woman up to?
She's got student council work.  
Well it's your fault that you provoked her in the first place.  
She didn't have to beat you up this badly though.  
I guess I deserved it.  
I guess I really am weak.  I need to hurry and master this.  
I think boys who don't give up are cool..
Yeah, I'm often jealous of you.  
Ichika-san you can stop by my room if you're feeling bitter.  I'll help with your troubles, not a problem.  
Wait a second Cecelia. Ichika, come to my room.  I have playing cards.  
Wait! I also have playing cards in my room.  
What about hanafuda cards Ichika?
I have playing cards in my room too.
